Introduction
India’s construction sector is a $740B industry in 2025, projected to cross $1.03T by 2030 (CAGR 6.87%). Yet, on the ground, critical decisions still rely on Excel sheets, WhatsApp approvals, Manual BOQ checks, Delayed procurement, On-site guesswork, Fragmented documentation. These inefficiencies create avoidable cost overruns, schedule delays, safety issues, procurement risks, and client dissatisfaction.
To address this, we built ConstructAI Command Center — a Gemini-powered Next.js platform built as a complete AI Intelligence Suite for builders, architects, engineers, project managers, clients, and suppliers.

➡️ Our mission:
Transform construction teams from manual firefighting to AI-backed decision making, across cost, safety, quality, planning, and procurement.

➡️ High-Level Architecture:
   - Next.js 15 gives SSR, App Router, parallel routes, fast interaction
   - Gemini gives domain reasoning & multi-role expertise
   - Turso provides edge-fast local data access
   - Recharts supports 50+ interactive construction analytics charts
   - Prompt templates guarantee consistent persona behavior
   - Shadcn UI gives a polished, enterprise-grade look

The result?
A platform that feels fast, intelligent, and tailor-made for construction.
